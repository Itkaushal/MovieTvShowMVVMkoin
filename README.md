📖 How It Works
Dependency Injection with Koin:

Koin modules are defined for ViewModels, repositories, and API clients.

val appModule = module {
    single { Retrofit.Builder().baseUrl(BASE_URL).build().create(ApiService::class.java) }
    single { Repository(get()) }
    viewModel { MovieViewModel(get()) }
}
Fetching Data with Retrofit:

Retrofit is used to fetch data from REST APIs asynchronously.
kotlin
Copy
Edit
@GET("trending/movies")
suspend fun getTrendingMovies(): Response<List<Movie>>
Image Loading with Coil:

Coil is used to load and cache images in the app.
kotlin
Copy
Edit
Image(
    painter = rememberImagePainter(data = movie.posterUrl),
    contentDescription = null
)
State Management with MVVM:

ViewModel exposes UI state using StateFlow or LiveData to observe changes in the UI.
